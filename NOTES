impl:
  declarations first
    prelude to setup types and functions
    macros
      declare-type declare-function declare-binding

  nested functions need to be lambdas in codegen

  write the extra compilation args to a file

  lambdas may close over variables
    reordering will not be allowed
    should everything just be in #main?

  verify all types going to codegen are shortened
    support generic shortened types

  better logging
    timbre (allows profiling, too)

  tests
    declarations
    comments within forms
    keywords
    per-commit performance?
      criterium benchmarking
    migrate old tests
      move parsing tests in old "translate" into parse/
      change typed tests to use declare instead of ƒ
        the ƒ macro does nothing right now

  targets
    each target has its own prelude

    (#target c++
             (#dependencies "gl/gl.h")
             (#command-line "-ggdb -Og -lGL"))

design:
  functions
    binding + lambda
    declaration based
      read the decl and keep a future to the definition
      auto return types will need to block on the future

  bindings
    declaration based (with futures)

  RAII
    shared_ptrs
