impl:
  write the extra compilation args to a file

  verify all types going to codegen are shortened
    support generic shortened types

  better logging
    timbre (allows profiling, too)

  sanitize idents which are keywords in backend language

  returning an integer literal and a jank integer is conflicting
    specify types for if statement returns

  allow first form of function calls to be a function call

  code within comments is being compiled?!

  tests
    declarations
    comments within forms
    keywords
    per-commit performance?
      criterium benchmarking
    codegen

  targets
    each target has its own prelude

    (#target c++
             (#dependencies "gl/gl.h")
             (#command-line "-ggdb -Og -lGL"))
