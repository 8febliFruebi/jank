impl:
  declarations first
    prelude to setup types and functions
    macros
      declare-type declare-function declare-binding

  function type deduction
  implicit function returns
    if statements, too
  remove return statement entirely

  tests
    decls
    keywords
    migrate old tests
    per-commit performance?
    move parsing tests in old "translate" into parse/
    change typed tests to use declare instead of ƒ
      the ƒ macro does nothing right now

  core.logic
    type checking

    use unification to determine the allowed types
    (ƒ sum (a Ɐ b Ɐ) (Ɐ)
      (+ a b))

design:
  functions
    binding + lambda
    declaration based
      read the decl and keep a future to the definition
      auto return types will need to block on the future
    always generic
      function can be a macro for not specifying generics
      generic-function is the default

  bindings
    declaration based (with futures)

  declarations of bindings and functions

  no interpreter outside of macros
    jump right into outputting C++14

  RAII
    shared_ptrs
