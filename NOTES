impl:
  write the extra compilation args to a file

  better logging
    timbre (allows profiling, too)

  sanitize idents which are keywords in backend language

  returning an integer literal and a jank integer is conflicting
    specify types for if statement returns

  test passing first class overloaded declared functions

  remove function-call from grammar; just use lists
    it becomes unhelpful with macros

  tests
    declarations
    comments within forms
      including functions
    keywords
    per-commit performance?
      criterium benchmarking
    codegen
    code execution (functional tests)

  targets
    each target has its own prelude
      c++
      bash
      opencl

    (#target c++
             (#dependencies "gl/gl.h")
             (#command-line "-ggdb -Og -lGL"))
