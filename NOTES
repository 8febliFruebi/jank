impl:
  write the extra compilation args to a file

  better logging
    timbre (allows profiling, too)

  sanitize idents which are keywords in backend language

  returning an integer literal and a jank integer is conflicting
    specify types for if statement returns

  handle Æ’ and other generic types in codegen

  test bindings within lambdas

  test passing first class overloaded declared functions

  test for returning a deduced lambda from a lambda

  remove function-call from grammar; just use lists
    it becomes unhelpful with macros

  tests
    declarations
    comments within forms
      including functions
    keywords
    per-commit performance?
      criterium benchmarking
    codegen

  targets
    each target has its own prelude
      c++
      bash
      opencl

    (#target c++
             (#dependencies "gl/gl.h")
             (#command-line "-ggdb -Og -lGL"))
