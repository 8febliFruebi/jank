impl:
  write the extra compilation args to a file

  better logging
    timbre (allows profiling, too)

  sanitize idents which are keywords in backend language

  returning an integer literal and a jank integer is conflicting
    specify types for if statement returns

  allow first form of function calls to be a function call

  code within comments is being compiled?!

  look into closures in a detailed fashion

  test returning a function of the wrong type

  b is not found here... scoping error?
    (bind make-func
      (λ () (ƒ : ((boolean string) (boolean)))
        (λ (b boolean s string) (boolean)
          (print! s)
          b)))

  tests
    declarations
    comments within forms
    keywords
    per-commit performance?
      criterium benchmarking
    codegen

  targets
    each target has its own prelude
      c++
      bash
      opencl

    (#target c++
             (#dependencies "gl/gl.h")
             (#command-line "-ggdb -Og -lGL"))
