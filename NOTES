impl:
  write the extra compilation args to a file

  verify all types going to codegen are shortened
    support generic shortened types

  better logging
    timbre (allows profiling, too)

  recursion + codegen
    need to use std::function, not auto

  sanitize idents which are keywords in backend language

  tests
    declarations
    comments within forms
    keywords
    per-commit performance?
      criterium benchmarking
    codegen

  targets
    each target has its own prelude

    (#target c++
             (#dependencies "gl/gl.h")
             (#command-line "-ggdb -Og -lGL"))
