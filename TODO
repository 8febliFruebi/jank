refactoring
  expect state

syntax errors...?
  will the regex remain?

idents
  allow numbers
  allow underscores

compilation
  build ast

tests

use long names
  func => function
  var => variable
  let => where

current list
  should be a tuple
  list should be a generic heterogenous container

allow unicode for specials
  function => ƒ
  lambda => λ

ambiguity with specializations
  (func foo :: (T) () ()
    )
    might be generic, but what if there is a type T present?
      it'll be a specialization
    use a specialization syntax instead

Maybes?
  clojure
    instaparse

  pattern matching
    replace car, cdr, cond, eq, atom
