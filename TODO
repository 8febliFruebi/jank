allow keywords?
  each keyword is its own type
  useful in the case of policies?

REPL
  add repl trait and compile separate lib
    allow multiple definitions
  online repl sandbox
  irc bot for #jank

clean up the testing process in cmakelists

add color to test failures

"falsey" is not a valid ident!!!

closures
  explicitly copy from scope? this may be messy

start with cons and lambdas
  list
  map
  filter
  reduce

custom types are dynamically allocated by default
  traits to control allocation? (later)
  reference counted a la shared_ptr
  copied on mutation
  explicit copy function as well

allow comments anywhere in forms

operators
  !=
  logical or, and, not, etc

stdlib
  print print-line format
  not and or
  even? odd?
  map, reduce, filter
  vector
  list
  map
  tuple

null
  allow null-typed bindings

syntax errors...?
  will the regex remain?
    need to map s-exprs to file positions
