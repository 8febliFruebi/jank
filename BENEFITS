immutability
  modularity and debuggability
    only focus on a single function (inputs and outputs)

  thread safety
    improve load times and responsiveness

  hacker detection
    integrity checks of the previous game state
    hashing can happen in parallel

  easier serialization
    the game state is a big, immutable, map

c++
  seamless integration with C and C++ libs
    calls to foreign libs can be inlined or elided

  decades of optimization work already done

  deterministic object lifetimes
