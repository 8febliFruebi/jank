  # With Cling 0.8 (not with master), Cling's CMake files don't work when compiling from
  # another CMake project. In particular, ClingConfig.cmake tries to include
  # ClingTargets.cmake, but it does so using ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}, which Cling thinks should
  # be Cling's root, but it's actually jank's. We fix this up by pointing it at the right place,
  # but this seems to have an impact on CLING_INCLUDE_DIRS being set, so you'll see we set that
  # manually as well. Wasn't an issue on Cling master, but we're stuck on 0.8 until this is fixed:
